<h1>Welcome to Numarchy</h1>
<h3>Here is a quick overview of this project</h6>
I am a 15 year old high school student and am looking to get into stocks. I decided to build this to assist me in that endeavor.
This project was made with XGBoost, and trained on data from Yahoo Finance.
<h3>Directions to use</h3>
The current model is already trained in the models folder. As of 1/28/2026 it is up to date. If you wish to update the model, do the following:
<h4>Run the populate_data.py file</h4>
This will go through and get the latest data off the yahoofinance api
<h4>Run the build_dataset.py file</h4>
This will build the full dataset and make it so that the model can be trained
<h4>Run the train_model.py file</h4>
Pretty self explanatory :)
<h4>Run the test_model.py file</h4>
This will give you a top 20 recommendation of likely stocks to beat the SP 500 in the next 6 months
